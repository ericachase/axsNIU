			<p><strong>What is Alpha Chi Sigma?</strong></p>
			<p>AXS is a coed professional chemistry fraternity founded in 1902. Now there are over 94 chapters nationally. We are the nationâ€™s only professional chemistry fraternity, founded for brotherhood, and based in a love for chemistry. Not only do we have a passion for chemistry but also a passion for our community. The purposes of Alpha Chi Sigma are reflected in the three Objects of the Fraternity, which express the ideals of all its members.</p>
			<p><strong>The Three Objetcs of Alpha Chi Sigma</strong></p>
			<p>1. To bind its members with a tie of true and lasting friendship <br/>
			   2. To strive for the advancement of chemistry, both as a science and a profession <br/>
			   3. To aid its members by every honorable means in the attainment of their ambitions as chemists throughout their mortal lives</p>
			<p>With AXS being over 100 years old and with over 56,000 members, we bring together men and women pursuing chemistry-related careers.</p>
